# pacman-search
My implementation of a program developed by UC Berkeley that trains an AI agent to play the classic game of Pac-Man

search.py contains four different algorithms used by AIs to search simulated spaces:

  - Depth-first search

  - Breadth-first search

  - Uniform-cost search

  - A* (A-star) search
